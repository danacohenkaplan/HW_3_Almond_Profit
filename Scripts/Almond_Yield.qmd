This assignment aims to model almond yield anomalies as a function of changes in climate using precipation and min and max temperature data. This exercise is modeled on analysis completed in Lobell et al 2006, and used the same equation and coefficients to do so. The regression equation is below: $$
Y = 0.015T{n,2} + 0.0046T^2{n,2} + 0.07P{1} + 0.0043P^2{1} + 0.28
$$ - Y = yield in tons/acre

-   T_n = Min temperature (C) in a month

-   P = Precipitation (mm) summed total precipitation for the month prior to a month

Subscript indicates type of data and month of climate variable (i.e. 1 = January, 2 = February)

# Connect Function and Read in Data

```{r almond yield}

#function source
source(here("almond_yield.R"))

#read in data

climate_df <- read.table("clim.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "")


#plot it to take a look
ggplot(climate_df, aes(x = as.Date(paste(year, month, "15", sep = "-")), group = 1)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = tmin_c, color = "Min Temp")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = tmax_c, color = "Max Temp")) +
  labs(
    x = "Date",
    y = "Temperature (°C)",
    title = "Monthly Average Min and Max Temperatures",
    color = "Temperature Type"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

```

Looks good! Time to run the function and loop it for each year, and store the results in a dataframe

# Run Function and Loop It

```{r}

# FOR LOOP

# create data frame to store the almond yield results for 1988-2010
yield_results <- data.frame(year = numeric(), yield = numeric())

# create vector of the years 1988-2010
years <- 1988:2010

#run the for loop for each year (yr) of the years vector

for (yr in years) {
  
  #section the data by year
  climate_year <- climate_df[climate_df$year == yr, ]
  
  #run the function using the sectioned data
  yield <- almond_yield(yr, climate_year)  
  
  #store the results in a dataframe
  yield_results <- rbind(yield_results,
                         data.frame(year = yr, yield = yield))
}

print(yield_results)

```

# Summary Analysis

```{r}

#calculate min, max, and mean yield anomalies
max(yield_results$yield, na.rm = TRUE)
min(yield_results$yield, na.rm = TRUE)
mean(yield_results$yield, na.rm = TRUE)


```

# Plot Yearly Anomalies

```{r}

#Plot the data to explore anomalies by year
ggplot(yield_results, aes(x = year, y = yield)) +
  geom_point(color = "darkgreen", size = 2) +               # points
  labs(
    title = "Almond Yield (1988–2010)",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Yield Anomaly (tons/acre)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    text = element_text(family = "serif", size = 12),
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold")
  )

```
